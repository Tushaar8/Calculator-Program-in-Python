Calculator Program in Python
This is a simple calculator program built in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Input:
The user is prompted to enter an arithmetic operator (either +, -, *, or /) followed by two numbers (num1 and num2).

Operations:
The calculator evaluates the operation based on the operator entered:
+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division
After performing the operation, the result is displayed with a precision of 3 decimal places.

Division by Zero:
If the user tries to divide by zero, the program will print an error message saying: Error! Division by zero.

Invalid Operator:
If the user enters an operator other than the four valid options (+, -, *, /) the program will print a message saying the operator is invalid.
